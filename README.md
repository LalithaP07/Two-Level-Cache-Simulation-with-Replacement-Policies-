# Two-Level-Cache-Simulation-with-Replacement-Policies-
Cache memory is an essential component of contemporary computer systems that helps to increase overall system performance by facilitating quick access to data that is often accessed. The goal of this research is to simulate cache memory activity and assess how various replacement rules affect cache performance. A two-level cache system is examined in relation to two main replacement policies: Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO). 

In order to simulate memory access patterns, the paper first implements a cache memory model that includes L1 and L2 caches. Cache hits, misses, and replacements are monitored using a range of workloads, such as sequential and random accesses. The purpose of the simulation is to provide light on how effective the caching mechanism is in various situations.
