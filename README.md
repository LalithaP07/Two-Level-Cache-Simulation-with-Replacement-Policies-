# Two-Level-Cache-Simulation-with-Replacement-Policies-
This research simulates cache memory activity to evaluate the impact of replacement policies on performance. A two-level cache system (L1 and L2) is modeled, focusing on Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) policies. Cache hits, misses, and replacements are analyzed across workloads like sequential and random accesses.
